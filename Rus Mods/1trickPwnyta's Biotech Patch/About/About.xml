This mod makes a handful of small tweaks to the Biotech DLC that are intended to make the game a bit more enjoyable without changing the gameplay too much. Each tweak can be toggled on or off in the mod settings.

=Children=
- The Child Labor: Encouraged precept requires children to be scheduled for at least 4 consecutive hours of work instead of requiring no scheduled recreation, since children don't recreate anyway.
- The text for the right-click command "Prioritize growing growth vat" is changed to "Prioritize loading growth vat".
- Children will not automatically gain a weird nickname like "Man" or "Dude" or "Bicep" at growth moments.
- Children are called by their first names by default, instead of sometimes going by their last names.
- Growth moment dialog trait/passion choices are colored. Traits are gray if they would be suppressed by a gene. Passions are red if they would conflict with a gene (such as Awful Mining).
- Bug fix: Traits selected at growth moment are unsuppressed by genes that should suppress them (pyrophobia/pyromaniac).
- Lactators can stop breastfeeding before the baby is full if something more important comes up (such as their own needs not being met).
- Bug fix: If a pawn giving birth is downed and then undowned during labor (such as labor going from debilitating to mild), the ritual is cancelled.
- Pawns won't move babies to a safer temperature until the baby has at least initial heatstroke/hypothermia.

=Genetics=
- The auto-wake setting is enabled by default for deathresters.
- A message appears at the top of the screen when a deathrester wakes up.
- The Health tab can be used to order xenogerm implantation even for xenogerms that are forbidden to the patient.
- An alert appears on the right side of the screen when a pawn is deficient in a drug they need in order to survive because of their genes.
- When ordering a pawn to priotitize creating a xenogerm, they will do it until finished instead of getting bored and leaving after a few seconds.
- Bug fix: Same xenogene/endogene can both cancel each other out if they give the same trait.
- Bug fix: Children of a custom xenotype and another custom xenotype or baseliner are labeled as baseliner.

=Mechanoids=
- Colony mechanoids are shown in the colonist bar.
- Mechs can be ordered to move outside the mechanitor's command range, since zones could be used to accomplish this anyway.
- Friendly mechs are assigned auto-repair be default.
- Bug fix: Abandoning the exostrider remains prevents mechanitor complex quest.
- Friendly mechs can be controlled even when their mechanitor is on a caravan, since the mechanitor doesn't have to be on the same map anyway.
- Friendly mechs can self-charge on top of power conduits and other non-chair standable buildings.
- Friendly mechs remember their control group assignment upon being resurrected.
- Friendly mechs with no energy who need to be carried to a recharger use a different symbol (power outage symbol vs. self charge symbol) and get an alert on the right side of the screen.
- Bug fix: Constructoids cannot be ordered to repair buildings such as doors while drafted.

=Miscellaneous=
- No more message spam when extracting hemogen from a prisoner of a hostile faction.
- No more message spam when wastepacks deteriorate outside of the home area.
